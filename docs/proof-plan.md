# Proof obligations

This is a dependency plan, not a completed proof. The three targets in
`SerrinEpigraph/Main.lean` remain unchanged from the source images.

## Automatic monotonicity

Write

$$
v=\partial_nu,\quad t=v/u,\quad z=t^-,\quad h(s)=f(s)-sf'(s).
$$

The intended argument has these obligations, each requiring an actual Lean proof:

1. **Epigraph geometry and traces.** Identify the boundary and closure, justify
   the within-closure differential, and derive positive vertical boundary
   derivative from the zero trace and constant negative Neumann data.
2. **Local integrability and support.** On every bounded region, the solution and
   its first derivatives extend continuously to the boundary. The negative
   quotient vanishes near the compact boundary portion. Thus the cutoff tests
   below have support in the interior and finite integrals.
3. **Weak differentiation.** Differentiate the equation distributionally and
   justify the quotient identity without adding a third classical derivative
   assumption on the solution.
4. **Kato inequality and power tests.** Prove the weak negative-part inequality

$$
-\operatorname{div}(u^2\nabla z)+u h(u)z\le0.
$$

   Test with nonnegative compactly supported Sobolev approximations and obtain

$$
\int u^2|\nabla(z^{q/2}\eta)|^2\le\int u^2z^q|\nabla\eta|^2,
\qquad q\ge2.
$$

   The current implementation instead uses even powers

$$
q=2p,\qquad p\ge2,
$$

   so that both the testing power and the energy power of the negative part are
   continuously differentiable. `Truncation.lean` and `QuotientTests.lean` prove
   this regularity, including zero points. `SparseMoments.lean` proves that the
   resulting odd moments alone suffice. The actual weak PDE testing estimate
   remains to be derived.

5. **Vertical integration by parts and Hölder.** Use the quotient's origin as a
   directional derivative, a high power of a ball cutoff, and Hölder to obtain

$$
\int_{\Omega\cap B_R}u^2z^k
\le\left(\frac{kC_\chi}{R}\right)^k
\int_{\Omega\cap B_{2R}}u^2,\qquad k\in\mathbb N,\quad k\ge3.
$$

6. **Growth contradiction.** If the negative quotient is positive at some point,
   continuity gives a fixed region of positive weighted measure on which it is
   bounded below. Choosing the integer power proportional to the radius forces a
   positive lower exponential mass-growth rate, contradicting the liminf assumption.
7. **Strict positivity.** A local strong maximum principle for the linearized
   equation gives positivity or identical vanishing. Vertical rays, positivity
   of the solution, and its zero boundary values exclude identical vanishing.

The boundary, integrability, support, and growth-contradiction steps are proved.
`WeakEquation.lean` proves the original PDE's weak formulation from its classical
form with only the stated second derivatives. `IntegrationByParts.lean` proves
the vertical identity. `BallCutoff.lean` constructs the scaled ball cutoffs, and
`Energy.lean`, `CauchyEnergy.lean`, and `MomentInterpolation.lean` prove the
algebraic and integral estimates used in the final moment closure.

Weak differentiation, the quotient power-testing estimate, and the strong
maximum principle remain open formalization obligations. They cannot be
replaced with extra hypotheses in the final theorem.

## Rigidity

The supplied citations do not currently discharge either rigidity obligation.
The Allen–Cahn assumptions in Wang–Wei and Beuvin–Farina are not among the common
image hypotheses. The zero reaction is a concrete admissible edge case that
prevents simply importing those informal theorems unchanged.

Both rigidity targets require a proof for the exact general reaction class,
followed by formalization of its analytic and geometric dependencies. A new
reference, a missing argument, or an actual counterexample would change this
assessment. No counterexample has been established. The project must not claim
completion while these targets remain open.

## Acceptance

All three proof targets must compile without proof holes, use only the standard
Lean axioms, match independent Challenge statements under Comparator, and pass
the complete pinned Palomar mechanical workflow before registry intake.
